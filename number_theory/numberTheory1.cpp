/*Diophantine Equations -
equation involving only sums, products and powers in which all the constants are integers and the only
solutions of interest are integers. For example, 3x + 7y = 1 or x2 âˆ’ y2 = z3, where x,y,z are integers.
*/

/*In competitive programming we deal with linear Diophantine Equations, ax + by = c.
**Note : a,b,c belong to Integers(N) and solutions to these equations only exist if
gcd(a,b) divides c.
*/

/*gcd(a,b) has a property that ax + by = gcd(a,b)
Let's do some maths,
ax + by = gcd(a,b);
gcd(a,b) = gcd(b,a%b);
gcd(b,a%b) = bx1 + (a%b)y1;
a%b = a - (a/b)*b;
From above relations,
ax + by = bx1 + (a%b)y1;
ax + by = bx1 + (a-(a/b)*b)y1;
ax + by = ay1 + b(x1-(a/b)y1);
Comparing the coefficients of a and b,
x = y1;
y = x1 - (a/b)*y1;

/*
gcd(p,0) = p;
ax + 0 = gcd(a,0) = a;
=> x = 1;
since b=0, y is not bothering, let's say y=0;
